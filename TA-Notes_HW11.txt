Excellent job on this assignment! I see that you skipped #12 and had some trouble pulling in the data for the last few questions -- Soma actually meant that you could type out a list of dictionaries for the additional population info for each borough. The other code you have looks correct, but depends on pulling in that data correctly. 

Let me know if you have any questions!
