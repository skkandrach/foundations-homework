Grade: 10 / 10

FYI, the script you submitted doesn't run from command line because a few lines needed to be commented out -- I created a file called Homework_9_Soma_graded.py where those edits have been made. Next time, be sure t  to test your script from the command line before submitting (because otherwise, your code is correct!).
